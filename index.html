		<p>Leave me! Leave me! I said to him. Who denies you this right? Have I ever tried to chain you with an oath? Est in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates, This terrible scene of the 20th of April none of us can ever forget. I have written it under the influence of violent emotion. Since then I have revised the recital; I have read it to Conseil and to the Canadian. They found it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to effect. To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of the most illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep.</p>

		<p>That is true, M. Aronnax, replied the captain; but I think you have serious reasons for wishing to see me? Yes, Ned. I crept along the carpet, avoiding the slightest sound which might betray my presence. I was at least five minutes reaching the door, at the opposite side, opening into the library. Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?</p>

		<h3 class="title">Wait, M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo. We will show you something</h3>	
		<p>We must ask Captain Nemo, said Conseil. I can picture it perfectly, said Conseil. But, sir, will you tell me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake? I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my observation, for the captain's head had already disappeared in its metal case. I finished harnessing myself, I felt them put an iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic, at a depth of 150 fathoms. Midnight was near. The waters were profoundly dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a sort of large light shining brilliantly, about two miles from the Nautilus. What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it lit up the liquid mass, I could not say. In any case, it did light our way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff apparatus. Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water.</p>
